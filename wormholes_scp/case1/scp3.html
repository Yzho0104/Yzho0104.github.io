                        interaction
                        must be approved by no less than a twothirds vote from O5-Command. Any such
                        interaction must be undertaken in AR-II
                        maximum security sites, after a general
                        non-essential staff evacuation. All staff (Research, Security, Class D, etc.) are to remain
                        at least sixty meters away from the containment cell at all times, except in the event of
                        breach events.<br><br>
                        SCP-106 is to be contained in a sealed container, comprised of lead-lined steel. The
                        container will be sealed within forty layers
                        of identical material, each layer separated
                        by no less than 36cm of empty space. Support struts between layers are to be randomly spaced.
                        Container is to remain
                        suspended no less than 60cm from any surface
                        by ELO-IID electromagnetic supports.<br><br>
                        Secondary containment area is to be comprised of sixteen spherical “cells”, each filled
                        with various fluids and a random assembly
                        of surfaces and supports. Secondary containment is to be fitted with light systems,
                        capable of flooding the entire assembly
                        with no less than 80,000 lumens of light instantly with no direct human involvement.
                        Both containment areas are to remain under 24 hour surveillance.<br><br>
                        Any corrosion observed on any containment cell surfaces, staff members, or other
                        site locations within two hundred meters of
                        SCP-106 are to be reported to Site Security
                        immediately. Any objects or personnel lost
                        to SCP-106 are to be deemed missing/KIA.
                        No recovery attempts are to be made under
                        any circumstances.
                        Note: Continued research and observation
                        have shown that, when faced with high</div>
                    <div class="fl">ly complex/random assemblies of structures, SCP-106 can be “confused”, showing
                        a marked delay on entry and exit from
                        said structure. SCP-106 has also shown an
                        aversion to direct, sudden light. This is not
                        manifested in any form of physical damage,
                        but a rapid exit in to the “pocket dimension”
                        generated on solid surfaces.<br><br>
                        These observations, along with those of
                        lead-aversion and liquid confusion, have reduced the general escape incidents by 43%.
                        The “primary” cells have also been effective
                        in recovery incidents requiring Recall Protocol. Observation is ongoing.<br><br>
                        Description: SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance
                        of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the “rotting” quality is
                        observed in all forms. SCP-106 is not exceptionally agile, and will remain motionless for
                        days at a time, waiting for prey. SCP-106 is
                        also capable of scaling any vertical surface
                        and can remain suspended upside down
                        indefinitely. When attacking, SCP-106 will
                        attempt to incapacitate prey by damaging
                        major organs, muscle groups, or tendons,
                        then pull disabled prey into its pocket dimension. SCP-106 appears to prefer human
                        prey items in the 10-25 years of age bracket.<br><br>
                        SCP-106 causes a “corrosion” effect in all
                        solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds
                        after contact. This is observed as rusting,
                        rotting, and cracking of materials, and the
                        creation of a black, mucus-like substance
                        similar to the material coating SCP-106. This
                        effect is particularly detrimental to living
                        tissues, and is assumed to be a “pre-digestion” action. Corrosion continues for six
                        hours after contact, after which the effect
                        appears to “burn out”.</div>
                    <div class="fl">SCP-106 is capable of passing through
                        solid matter, leaving behind a large patch
                        of its corrosive mucus. SCP-106 is able to
                        “vanish” inside solid matter, entering what
                        is assumed to be a form of “pocket dimension”. SCP-106 is then able to exit this dimension from
                        any point connected to
                        the
                        initial entry point (examples: “entering” the
                        inner wall of a room, and “exiting” the outer
                        wall. Entering a wall, and exiting from the
                        ceiling). It is unknown if this is the point of
                        origin for SCP-106, or a simple “lair” created
                        by SCP-106.<br><br>
                        Limited observation of this “pocket dimension” has shown it to be comprised mostly
                        of halls and rooms, with [DATA EXPUNGED]
                        entry. This activity can continue for days,
                        with some subjected individuals being released for the express purpose of hunting,
                        recapture, [DATA EXPUNGED].</div>
