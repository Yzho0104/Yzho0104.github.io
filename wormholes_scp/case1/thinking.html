                <p class="txt">How can they continue to retain their
                    power and autonomy?</p>
                <div class="contxt fn-clear">
                    <div class="fl">While certainly painting with a broad
                        brush, people vanish without a trace all
                        of the time. Even more so in the «not first
                        world» countries. If the organization has
                        any complicity with the government,
                        at any level, it gets even easier as
                        investigations get neglected or shut down.
                        Do people make noise? Sure they do, but
                        the question becomes whether anyone is
                        listening. A lone fathers eternal vigil for their
                        child tends to be just that: alone. Shared
                        closely, but never really expanding to greater
                        attention. Not every family puts a billboard
                        on their property calling out crimes.<br><br>
                        The bigger problem isn’t the individual
                        «disappearances», its any higher level of
                        pattern that perhaps can be intuited over
                        time. But even then, that’s «crazy talk».
                        Books like this are written all the time.
                        Folks love reading about a conspiracy! But
                        then there’s the problem: it’s a conspiracy.
                        While «the internet» does give people</div>
                    <div class="fl">a voice, it also gives EVERYONE a voice.
                        «Signal to noise» ratio on «the internet»
                        isn’t really regarded as high quality.
                        Large organizations are implicitly inefficient
                        and filled with «lossy» communications.
                        There’s LOTS of cracks for important details
                        to fall in to and never be seen again.<br><br>
                        Navigated by an expert team, remaining
                        hidden «in plain sight» can be done.
                        Finally, as anyone who’s done any real
                        digging in to, well, most anything, we find
                        that the eternal memory of the internet is
                        anything but. Link rot is real, Google is not all
                        seeing, web sites come and go all the time. So,
                        even then, digital vigils can eventually fade.
                        So I simply assert that the problem isn’t
                        perhaps as difficult as you may think it is.
                        Watching some episodes of the X-Files
                        as a resource of cover up colliding with
                        bureaucracy is probably a useful exercise.<br><br>

                    <div class="fl">organisations that «retain their secrecy
                        by containing or eliminating threats, and
                        making those who know things they
                        shouldn’t disappear,» there are several ways
