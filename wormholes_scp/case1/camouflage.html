                    there is an SCP out there that can erase
                    credible data from the internet as soon
                    as it is uploaded or can rework public
                    consciousness to thinking all these sightings
                    are merely hoaxes, movie sets, and so forth.
                    People are really only dangerous in groups.
                    One lone person can be easily erased if they
