                        that are exceedingly difficult to contain
                        consistently or reliably, with containment
                        procedures often being extensive and
                        complex. The Foundation often can’t
                        contain these SCPs well due to not having
                        a solid understanding of the anomaly, or
                        lacking the technology to properly contain
                        or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean
                        the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply
                        very difficult or costly to contain.<br><br>
                        Class Thaumiel : Thaumiel-class SCPs
                        are anomalies that the Foundation uses
                        to contain or counteract other SCPs or
                        anomalous phenomena. Even the mere
                        existence of Thaumiel-class objects is
                        classified at the highest levels of the
                        Foundation and their locations, functions,
                        and current status are known to few
                        Foundation personnel outside of the O5
                        Council</div>

                        recontain, it’s properties pose a serious and
                        immediate threat to human life.<br><br>
                        Class Neutralized : Neutralized SCPs are
                        anomalies that are no longer anomalous,
                        either through having been intentionally or
                        accidentally destroyed, or disabled.<br><br>
                        There are also other SCP Classes, but that
                        are not confirmed/offical classes. But it does
                        not change the fact some Foundation sites
                        use them.<br><br>
                        Class Explained : Explained SCPs are
                        commonly articles about anomalies that
                        are completely and fully understood to
                        the point where their effects are now
                        explainable by mainstream science or
                        phenomena that have been debunked or
                        falsely mistaken as an anomaly</div>
