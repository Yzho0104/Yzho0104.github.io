                        is located on the campus of [REDACTED].
                        The doorway leading to SCP-087 is
                        constructed of reinforced steel with an
                        electro-release lock mechanism. It has been
                        disguised to resemble a janitorial closet
                        consistent with the design of the building.
                        The lock mechanism on the doorknob
                        will not release unless volts are applied
                        in conjunction with counter-clockwise
                        rotation of the key. The inside of the door is
                        lined with 6 centimeters of industrial foam
                        padding.<br><br>
                        Due to the results of the final exploration
                        (see Document 087-IV), no personnel are
                        permitted access to SCP-087.<br><br>
                        Description: SCP-087 is an unlit platform
                        staircase. Stairs descend on a 38 degree
                        angle for 13 steps before reaching a
                        semicircular platform of approximately
                        3 meters in diameter. Descent direction
                        rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The
                        design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual
                        range of approximately 1.5 flights. A light
                        source is required for any subjects exploring
                        SCP-087, as there are no lighting fixtures or
                        windows present. Lighting sources brighter
                        than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective,
                        as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess ligZt</div>
                    <div class="fl">Subjects report and audio recordings
                        confirm the distressed vocalizations from
                        what is presumed to be a child between
                        the ages of ? and ??. The source of the
                        distress calls is estimated to be located
                        approximately 200 meters below the
                        initial platform. However, any attempts to
                        descend the staircase have failed to bring
                        subjects closer to the source. The depth
                        of descent calculated from Exploration IV,
                        the longest exploration, is shown to be far
                        beyond both the possible structure of both
                        the building and geological surroundings.
                        At this time, it is unknown if SCP-087 has an
                        endpoint.<br><br>
                        SCP-087 has undergone four video recorded
                        explorations by Class-DZpersonnel. Each
                        subject conducting an exploration has
                        encountered SCP-087-1, which appears
                        as a face with no visible pupils, nostrils, or
                        mouth. The nature of SCP-087-1 is entirely
                        unclear, but it has been determined that it
                        is not the source of the pleading. Subjects
                        exhibit feelings of intense paranoia and
                        fear when faced with SCP-087-1, but it is
                        undetermined whether said feelings are
                        abnormal or simply natural reactions.<br><br>
                        Addendum:<br><br>
                        Over a period of 2 weeks following
                        Exploration IV, several members of the staff</div>
                    <div class="fl">and students from the [REDACTED] campus
                        reported knocking at a variable rate of 1-2
                        seconds per knock coming from the interior
                        of SCP-087. The door leading to SCP-087
                        has been fitted with 6 centimeter thick
                        industrial padding. All reports of knocking
                        have ceased.</div>
