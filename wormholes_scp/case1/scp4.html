                        Special Containment Procedures: SCP-049 is
                        contained within a Standard Secure Humanoid
                        Containment Cell in Research Sector-02 at Site-19.
                        SCP-049 must be sedated before any attempts to
                        transport it. During transport, SCP-049 must be
                        secured within a Class III Humanoid Restriction
                        Harness (including a locking collar and extension
                        restraints) and monitored by no fewer than two
                        armed guards.<br><br>
                        While SCP-049 is generally cooperative with
                        most Foundation personnel, outbursts or sudden
                        changes in behaviour are to be met with elevated
                        force. Under no circumstances should any personnel
                        come into direct contact with SCP-049 during
                        these outbursts. In the event SCP-049 becomes
                        aggressive, the application of lavender (L. multifida)
                        has been shown to produce a calming effect on the
                        entity. Once calmed, SCP-049 generally becomes
                        compliant, and will return to containment with
                        little resistance.

                <div class="fl">Description: SCP-049 is a humanoid entity,
                    roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears
                    the appearance of a medieval plague
                    doctor. While SCP-049 appears to be
                    wearing the thick robes and the ceramic
                    mask indicative of that profession, the
                    garments instead seem to have grown out
                    of SCP-049’s body over time1, and are now
                    nearly indistinguishable from whatever
                    form is beneath them. X-rays indicate that
                    despite this, SCP-049 does have a humanoid
                    skeletal structure beneath its outer layer.<br><br>
                    SCP-049 is capable of speech in a variety of
                    languages, though tends to prefer English
                    or medieval French2. While SCP-049 is
                    generally cordial and cooperative with
                    Foundation staff, it can become especially
                    irritated or at times outright aggressive if it
                    feels that it is in the presence of what it calls
                    the «Pestilence». Although the exact nature
                    of this Pestilence is currently unknown to
                    Foundation researchers, it does seem to be
                    an issue of immense concern to SCP-049.<br><br>
                    SCP-049 will become hostile with individuals</div>
                <div class="fl">it sees as being affected by the Pestilence,
                    often having to be restrained should it
                    encounter such. If left unchecked, SCP-
                    049 will generally attempt to kill any such
                    individual; SCP-049 is capable of causing
                    all biological functions of an organism to
                    cease through direct skin contact. How this
                    occurs is currently unknown, and autopsies
                    of SCP-049’s victims have invariably been
                    inconclusive. SCP-049 has expressed
                    frustration or remorse after these killings,
                    indicating that they have done little to kill
                    «The Pestilence», though will usually seek to
                    then perform a crude surgery on the corpse
                    using the implements contained within a
                    black doctor’s bag it carries on its person
                    at all times3. While these surgeries are not
                    always «successful», they often result in the
                    creation of instances of SCP-049-2.</div>
