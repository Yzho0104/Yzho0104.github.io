                        A few decades ago, a photo was a certain
                        proof that something exists. Today your
                        realistic smartphone footage of bigfoot
                        might be photoshopped by a fifteen year
                        old living in their parents basement. Only
                        idiots believe all those conspiracy theories
                        without proof from a credible source. (And
                        if SCP exists, they certainly run the majority
                        of fact-checking websites).
                        In the same way, the news-cycle is faster then
                        ever. There is no time for long investigations
                        and even if some journalist actually has a
                        story about incredible objects, that’s just
                        fake news and conspiracy theories. If the
                        media persists, just release the next sextape, arrange for a mass shooting or jus</div>
                    <div class="fl">wait for the next public statement by the
                        president and your story will be old news.
                        Concerning test subjects, simply don’t
                        recruit from first world countries anymore.
                        There are more than enough Mexicans
                        vanishing in mass graves in some drug war,
                        refugees drowning in the Mediterranean
                        and accused drug dealers being shot in the
                        Philippines.
                        Concerning leaks, your surveillance is
                        always improving and the people working
                        for you know that. While a few decades ago,
                        they might have gotten away with sending
                        an envelope to some journalist, today the
                        gps in their phones (leaving home without it
                        will definitely be cause for an investigation)
                        will tell you precisely when they went to</div>
                    <div class="fl">the mailbox. And if they are crazy enough
                        to try something anyways, did you know
                        that many parts, including power-steering,
                        in modern cars are controlled by computers
                        nowadays?
                        Certainly, there might be stupid politicians
                        but the politicians never get told anything
                        important anyway. Some may have
                        stumbled upon the deep state, but they are
                        completely oblivious to its true purpose.
                        Finally the most important part: Create a
                        website where you catalogue all the things
                        that you are storing. Call it scp-wiki or
                        something. Then whenever someone gets
                        wind of some of your operations, just point
                        them to the appropriate entry and tell them
                        that they</div>
