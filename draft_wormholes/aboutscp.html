                <div class="contxt fn-clear">
                    <div class="fl">The SCP is an organization created after
                        World War 2 that deals with threats to our
                        species and the entire planet: mystical
                        or alien artifacts, world-ending events,
                        ancient monsters or gods that predate
                        humanity, and other things best left
                        unsaid. They require the cooperation of
                        world governments and other interested
                        parties that are informed of the necessity
                        of this organization and their sometimesbrutal methods. They retain their secrecy
                        by containing or eliminating threats,
                        and making those who know things
                        they shouldn’t, disappear. They are also
                        responsible for discovering how the
                        artifacts work, and they use various groups
                        of people (prisoners, witnesses, etc.) as
                        guinea pigs.
                        In the past, it was relatively easy to conduct
                        their affairs in secret. However, the world
                        in 2018 is much different than the 1940s.
                        We live in the age of Facebook and Twitter,</div>
                    <div class="fl">where a picture posted on the internet
                        can last forever. Cellphone cameras and
                        GPS have made it more difficult to remain
                        anonymous. Loved ones of prisoners and
                        «disappeared» people are making noise
                        and asking questions. People cannot
                        just vanish without a trace anymore. The
                        world is getting smaller everyday, with
                        the advancement of technology and
                        its availability to the public. Ambitious
                        journalists eager for a story have taken to
                        wiretapping and recording conversations
                        with officials. In addition to this, politics
                        is becoming more and more divided. A
                        controversial president has been elected
                        who has thrown his government into
                        chaos with his constant firings, antagonism
                        towards the media, and arguably
                        divisive relationship with his colleagues.
                        Government leaks have become a constant
                        issue, and it is becoming much harder for
                        governments to keep secrets.</div>
