                    Special Containment Procedures: SCP-049 is
                    contained within a Standard Secure Humanoid
                    Containment Cell in Research Sector-02 at Site-19.
                    SCP-049 must be sedated before any attempts to
                    transport it. During transport, SCP-049 must be
                    secured within a Class III Humanoid Restriction
                    Harness (including a locking collar and extension
                    restraints) and monitored by no fewer than two
                    armed guards.
                    While SCP-049 is generally cooperative with
                    most Foundation personnel, outbursts or sudden
                    changes in behaviour are to be met with elevated
                    force. Under no circumstances should any personnel
                    come into direct contact with SCP-049 during
                    these outbursts. In the event SCP-049 becomes
                    aggressive, the application of lavender (L. multifida)
                    has been shown to produce a calming effect on the
                    entity. Once calmed, SCP-049 generally becomes
                    compliant, and will return to containment with
                    little resistance.

            <div class="fl">Description: SCP-049 is a humanoid entity,
                roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears
                the appearance of a medieval plague
                doctor. While SCP-049 appears to be
                wearing the thick robes and the ceramic
                mask indicative of that profession, the
                garments instead seem to have grown out
                of SCP-049’s body over time1, and are now
                nearly indistinguishable from whatever
                form is beneath them. X-rays indicate that
                despite this, SCP-049 does have a humanoid
                skeletal structure beneath its outer layer.
                SCP-049 is capable of speech in a variety of
                languages, though tends to prefer English
                or medieval French2. While SCP-049 is
                generally cordial and cooperative with
                Foundation staff, it can become especially
                irritated or at times outright aggressive if it
                feels that it is in the presence of what it calls
                the «Pestilence». Although the exact nature
                of this Pestilence is currently unknown to
                Foundation researchers, it does seem to be
                an issue of immense concern to SCP-049.
                SCP-049 will become hostile with individuals</div>
            <div class="fl">it sees as being affected by the Pestilence,
                often having to be restrained should it
                encounter such. If left unchecked, SCP-
                049 will generally attempt to kill any such
                individual; SCP-049 is capable of causing
                all biological functions of an organism to
                cease through direct skin contact. How this
                occurs is currently unknown, and autopsies
                of SCP-049’s victims have invariably been
                inconclusive. SCP-049 has expressed
                frustration or remorse after these killings,
                indicating that they have done little to kill
                «The Pestilence», though will usually seek to
                then perform a crude surgery on the corpse
                using the implements contained within a
                black doctor’s bag it carries on its person
                at all times3. While these surgeries are not
                always «successful», they often result in the
                creation of instances of SCP-049-2.</div>
