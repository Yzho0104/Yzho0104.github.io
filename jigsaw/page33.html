                YouTuber Simone Giertz originally appeared on our radar
                in 2016 as the self-proclaimed Queen of Shitty Robots. Since
                then, Giertz has built whacky, wonderful and shockingly useful
                things. Some of which we desperately want for our dogs. The
                creator’s latest project, however, may genuinely be her most
                beautiful and functional build yet: a two-in-one puzzle and
                dinner table that’s also a masterpiece of woodworking.

            <p class="desc">Giertz recently posted the two-in-one table to her eponymous YouTube channel. As the
                “inventor and breaker of things”
                notes
                toward the beginning of the video, she decided to tackle the project because she didn’t have enough room
                to both do
                jigsaw
                puzzles and eat food on her dining room table. Incidentally, it’s a common problem for LEGO lovers as
                well.
                In the 20ish minute long build video Giertz shows how she conceptualized and built the ingenious
                surface. As the creator
                notes,
                the dual-top table is unique from many other board game tables as it doesn’ t require a separate top
                piece. Instead,
                Giertz’s table
                essentially works like a hand-cranked treadmill. It has a running belt consisting of tambour—a pretty,
                yet notoriously
                finicky type
                of wood.</p>
            <p class="desc">In all, Giertz took more than two months to build the table, pushing through some harrowing
                experiences during the
                process. She
                not only had to overcome her fears of lathes, but also contend with anxious work dreams. And pressure on
                her thumbs that
                was so
                bad she needed to 3D print a tiny tub just to soothe them.</p>
            <p class="desc">The agonizing process was undoubtedly worth it. Giertz reveals the final product at around
                the 15 minute mark in the
                video. It’s
                a truly awesome piece of furniture. Although Giertz says the table is “over-engineered,” its complexity
                makes for a
                clean, simple
                design. Heck, we’d even just sit there turning the table’s knobs for fun. Which sounds about as exciting
                as doing a
                jigsaw
                puzzle? Just kidding, puzzle peeps, we know it can be… thrilling.</p>
