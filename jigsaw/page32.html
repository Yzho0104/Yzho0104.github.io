    <h2>Japanese puzzles that can drive you<br>
        crazy, "pure white hell" and "dark hell"</h2>

    <p class="desc">To what extent can a person abuse himself? What kind of motivation was used to invent such a jigsaw
        puzzle? These are
        unknown, but
        at the first glance at this "pure hell", I believe you will never have the urge to play it.
        This extremely challenging jigsaw puzzle game was created by a sadomasochistic designer from Beverly, Japan. It
        has a
        1000-piece
        version and a 2000-piece version.</p>
    <p class="desc">
        All puzzles are made of a solid color template, which is cut into countless small pieces. As long as they are
        scattered,
        you will feel that
        all the puzzle pieces are exactly the same, and there is no sense of contradiction where they are placed.
        But the pain is that all you see are cruel illusions.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        The puzzle is actually composed of seven different shapes of small pieces, and each piece has its proper
        position.
        Although it seems
        that any two pieces can be spliced together, if you find that it is more laborious when splicing, or there is an
        obvious
        dislocation, it
        means you made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        A mistake in one place may cause a wide range of dislocations, and you often cannot find them in time. After you
        really
        feel that
        something is wrong, you may have to overthrow it all and start over. And the feeling of falling into hell is the
        inspiration for the name
        of this game.
